## 1. Title
Gender Representation in the Film Industry
## 2. Abstract
The goal of this project is to study gender representation in the film industry. We will examine whether or not men and women receive roles based on gender stereotypes, and we will also investigate the distribution of lead roles between the sexes in different movie genres over time. Additionally, we will analyze the extent to which the "Smurfette principle" occurs in the film industry. This principle refers to the inclusion of only one woman in an otherwise entirely male ensemble, which establishes a male-dominated narrative where the woman is the exception and exists only in reference to the men.
## 3. Research Questions
- How are men and women represented in different movie genres?
- To what extent do gender stereotypes play a role in the roles men and women receive in films?
- How does the distribution of lead roles between men and women vary across different movie genres over time?
- To what extent does the "Smurfette principle" occur in the film industry?
## 4. Methods:
The first step, which has already been started in the notebook is the importation, pre-processing and combining of the data from the dataset.
Since our analyses will be based mainly on the characters, relating them with the movies they are in and the personality of said character, these datasets have to be combined. This is a critical step since any mistake in the combination of the data could lead to big problems further down the line.

The next step will have to be a first analysis and visualisation of the data.
As it is expected that not all our points of analyses will bring significant results, this step will allow us to go back into the data processing and extraction in hopes of finding more significant results. We have not yet felt the need to include any additional data than that contained in the CMU Movie Summary Corpus and the Stanford CoreNLP-processed summaries, but it is not out of the question that we notice a need for more specific data on a topic later in our analyses.

The final part is the website creation, we will use Github Pages to host our website, and we will also make use of the library "plotly" to make interactive graphs.
## 5. Proposed timeline
1. Import and pre-process data from the CMU Movie Summary Corpus and the Stanford CoreNLP-processed summaries (Week 1)
2. Combine datasets to create a single dataset with information on characters, movies, and character personalities (Week 2)
3. Conduct initial analysis and visualization of data (Week 3)
4. Perform statistical analysis to quantify significant findings (Week 4)
5. Create results page with interactive graphs and visualizations (Week 5)
