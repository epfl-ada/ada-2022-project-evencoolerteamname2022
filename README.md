# EvenCoolerTeamName2022 project
Authors: Eloi, Mateo, Aitor

### Abstract
The core idea of this project is the the representation of gender in the film industry. Usually roles assigned to women and men are based on stereotypes. Gender stereotypes are beliefs concerning the abilities, attitudes, preferences and behaviors of a ‘typical’ man or a ‘typical’ woman[1]. For example, many people believe women roles are more centered around the idea of beauty and love, whereas men roles are more focused on action and comedy. In this study, we will analyze if women and men do indeed receive roles based on stereotypes, and we will also study the repartition of lead roles between the sexes in different movie genres through time.
### Main question:
#### What defines each gender in a movie ?
- Stereotypes from tvtropes, which are the most prominent ones ?
  - Representation of men vs women in the different movie genres.
  - How are movie genres characterised by stereotypes among men and women.
  - Which gender is more heavily described for their physical attributes ?
  - Are women more likely to be involved in a love story ?
- Is there a gender gap regarding the age of the actors.
- Representation of each gender in movies through time.

### Methods and timeline:
The first step, which has already been started in the notebook is the importation, pre-processing and combining of the data from the dataset.
Since our analyses will be based mainly on the characters, relating them with the movies they are in and the personality of said character, these datasets have to be combined. This is a critical step since any mistake in the combination of the data could lead to big problems further down the line.

The next step will have to be a first analysis and visualisation of the data.
As it is expected that not all our points of analyses will bring significant results, this step will allow us to go back into the data processing and extraction in hopes of finding more significant results. We have not yet felt the need to include any additional data than that contained in the CMU Movie Summary Corpus and the Stanford CoreNLP-processed summaries, but it is not out of the question that we notice a need for more specific data on a topic later in our analyses.

The final part would have to be the creation of the results page, with interactive graphs and visualisations.
