# EvenCoolerTeamName2022 project
Authors: Eloi, Mateo, Aitor

### Abstract
The core idea of this project is the the representation of gender in the film industry. Usually roles assigned to women and men are based on stereotypes. Gender stereotypes are beliefs concerning the abilities, attitudes, preferences and behaviors of a ‘typical’ man or a ‘typical’ woman[1]. For example, many people believe women roles are more centered around the idea of beauty and love, whereas men roles are more focused on action and comedy. In this study, we will analyze if women and men do indeed receive roles based on stereotypes, and we will also study the repartition of lead roles between the sexes in different movie genres through time.
### Main question 1:
#### What defines each gender in a movie ?
- Stereotypes from tvtropes, which are the most prominent ones ?
  - Representation of men vs women in the different movie genres.
  - Which gender is more heavily described for their physical attributes ?
  - Are women more likely to be involved in a love story ?
- Representation of each gender in movies through time
