### Abstract
Many people have gender stereotypes. Gender stereotypes are beliefs concerning the abilities, attitudes, preferences and behaviors of a ‘typical’ man or a ‘typical’ woman[1]. For example, many people believe that women have better verbal abilities than men, whereas men are assumed to have better mathematical skills than women. Whereas research has partly confirmed the former assumption (e.g., for verbal fluency[2]), it has disconfirmed the latter. Because stereotypes may, at least partly, reflect real differences between groups, stereotypes are not necessarily inaccurate[3]. Hence, “the accuracy of stereotypes is an empirical question, not an ideological one”. Previous research has already addressed the accuracy of gender stereotypes concerning attitudes or cognitive abilities, but there is almost no research about the accuracy of gender stereotypes. The present study thus compared presumed and actual differences in men and women roles in the film industry.

### Main question 1:
#### What defines each gender in a movie ?
- Stereotypes from tvtropes, which are the most prominent ones ?
  - Representation of men vs women in the different movie genres.
  - Which gender is more heavily described for their physical attributes ?
  - Are women more likely to be involved in a love story ?
- Representation of each gender in movies through time
